ðŸ“– Overview

- A distinct epigenetic hallmark of plants is the presence of DNA methylation in non-CG contexts. While the physiological roles of non-CG methylation are well established, its direct impact on transcription factor (TF)â€“DNA interactions remains largely unexplored.

- In this study, we focused on the WRKY transcription factor family and systematically investigated how non-CG methylation influences their DNA-binding specificity and genome-wide cis-regulatory elements (CREs).

ðŸ”¬ Key Findings

- High-throughput profiling: Generated 461 SELEX and DAP-seq libraries for 54 Arabidopsis thaliana WRKYs.

- Specificity divergence: DNA methylation reshapes both monomeric and dimeric binding specificities, leading to greater divergence among WRKY family members.

- Novel motifs: Curated 201 WRKY motifs, clustered into 11 classes, including 5 previously unreported specificities.

- Methylation-dependent recognition: The canonical WRKY cis-element PRE4 is recognized only when methylated.

- Regulatory determinants: Identified the amino-acid discriminants governing W-box vs. WT-box recognition.

- Bidirectional effect: Demonstrated that methylation can both decrease and increase WRKY binding affinity, globally reshaping the WRKY binding landscape.
